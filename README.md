## A simple inbox application using solidity

This sample app uses source-code from Stephen Griders course on [Ethereum and Solidity](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/).

### Code features

 - allows you to send message to a blockchain
 - allows you to read message from a blockchain
 - test your code locally using mocha and Ganache
 - deploy to rinkeby.infura.io using your Metamask wallet
 - understand how Solidity works in the Ethereum blockchain

 #### This is my naive attempt at learning Solidity programming.
